## 0.3.3

### Breaking Changes

- This package is no longer supported from Atmosphere, and will be installed from NPM from Meteor 1.3 and up.
- Removed `bootstrap` module (`angular2-meteor/bootstrap`) in favor of the original Angular 2.0 bootstrap's.
- Removed `packages/*` - they will be moved into a separated NPM modules in the future.
- Imports location will be defined as NPM imports: `import {SomePackage} from 'angular2-meteor/cursor_handlers';`
- Removed the need for `SystemJS`, now uses Meteor's ES6 imports that depends on CommonJS.

### Updates

- Build process now use Webpack instead of Meteor build tool.
- Tests now executed inside a Meteor context which means that there is a meteor app that uses the actual code, because Angular2-Meteor now does not depends of Meteor packages system (Atmosphere) and uses NPM instead.
